*Title: AI Chatbot using DeepSeek API*

*Introduction:*
 I'm excited to present my chatbot project—a smart conversational agent designed to interact with users in a human-like manner. It leverages modern AI capabilities to provide responses that are both relevant and context-aware.

*Overview:*
The chatbot is built using the DeepSeek API, which allows it to generate intelligent, real-time responses. It supports natural language processing tasks like answering questions, casual conversation, and more—making it suitable for use cases such as customer support, personal assistants, or educational tools.

*Technologies Used:*

* *DeepSeek API:* Powers the chatbot’s core intelligence and response generation.
* *HTML & CSS:* Used to design a clean, responsive, and user-friendly chat interface.
* *MongoDB:* Stores chat history and user interactions, which can be useful for analytics or improving the system over time.

*Key Features:*

* Real-time conversational experience
* Clean and intuitive user interface
* Persistent chat history with MongoDB
* Modular and scalable architecture

*Conclusion:*
This project not only demonstrates the integration of cutting-edge AI APIs with front-end and back-end technologies but also lays the foundation for more advanced applications, such as personalized chatbots, multilingual support, or domain-specific assistants.

Thank you!
